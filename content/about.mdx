I build 0 to 1 startup products, exploring fields in business operations and music education.

I was previously a software engineer at Solana Labs. I built a payments product that processed over $80M in volume through integrations with platforms like Shopify, and developed production-grade backend infrastructure for on-chain game studios.

I triple majored in Math, Computer Science, and Statistics at Rutgers in 2.5 years. I lived on campus the last 1.5 years, exploring philosophy, history, and various arts, graduating officially in 2023.

After graduating, I spent a year at home working and spending time with family, then moved to Fort Lauderdale in 2024â€”where a mix of travel, autonomy, and new friendships pushed me to rethink what I actually value.
