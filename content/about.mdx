I build 0 to 1 startup products as a software engineer at Solana Labs.

I triple majored in Math, Computer Science, and Statistics at Rutgers in 2.5 years. I lived on campus the last 1.5 years, exploring philosophy, history, and various arts, graduating officially in 2023.

I spent a year living at home after graduation, locking in at work & spending time with family.

I moved to Fort Lauderdale in 2024, and between new friendships, constant travel, autonomy, learned a lot about what i do and don't value.

Lets see what 2025 has in store :)
