It's dangerously simple to let a new personal website die a lonely death. Case in pointâ€”my last website.

This time around, my workflow intends to be intimately interlinked, with notes, videos, and code all working together to deliver a comprehensive message.

This post corresponds to my brand-building video, where I set up this website and the mindset around it. The code was heavily adapted from Lee Rob's repo, taking bits and pieces from it to experiment with new NextJS and other tech features, but offloading most of the design choices for now.

Ideally, the website will adapt to how I create in the future, but I just wanted to get something started.
